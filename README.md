### Project Overview

This project aims to understand sales performance for a retail company to help them make strategic decisions on how to increase sales revenue by 15% next quarter. By executing the project successfully, I seek to help identify trends and patterns, make data-driven recommendations and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Tool

- Excel
  - For data cleaning, data analysis, creating reports.


### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handled missing values - replaced blank values with Null and N/A
3. Data cleaning and formatting - converted all currency from pounds to dollars.


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- What products are top sellers?
- What is the overall yearly sales trend?
				

### Results
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1.  The company recorded its highest sales in 1985 and was steadily increasing until the year 1998 where it hit a major bottom.
2.  Fruits and vegetables, snack foods, household, frozen food, and dairy are the best performaming products in items of sales and revenue.

### Recommendation

Based on the analysis, i recommend the following actions:
- Ensure we are never out/low stock of our top 5 selling products.
